“Crazy Eights” - Brainstorming, Crowdfiltered.

Description:
This app will allow the user to leverage the power of crowdfiltering to assist in the brainstorming process. Over the course of two rounds of user input the app will use a major search engine to filter eight short, relatively abstract ideas down to two more specific, relatively detailed ideas, based on the popularity of the terms given.

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

APIs used:
Bing Search API, Aylien Text Analysis API (or maybe Watson).

MVP goals:
Allow user input of 8 ideas, limited to a small number of characters.
Use Bing Search API to narrow those to 4 ideas, based on total number of web hits.
Return the 4 ideas in larger textareas, and allow the user to expand on the ideas.
Use Aylien or Watson to analyze the text for some number of keyword combinations, and pass each of those back to Bing Search API, aggregating the total hits for each keyword combination.
Return the two ideas with the most aggregate hits.
